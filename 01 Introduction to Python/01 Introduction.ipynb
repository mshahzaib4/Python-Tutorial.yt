    "# Python Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world due to its versatility and ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features of Python:\n",
    "- **Easy to Read and Write:** Python emphasizes code readability and uses indentation to define code blocks, making it easy to understand even for beginners.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Versatile:** Python can be used for a wide range of applications, including:\n",
    "  - Web Development\n",
    "  - Data Analysis\n",
    "  - Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "  - Machine Learning\n",
    "  - Scientific Computing\n",
    "  - Automation, and more.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Interpreted Language:** Python code is executed line by line, making it easy to test code snippets and debug programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Uses of Python:\n",
    "- **Web Development:** Python can be used to create dynamic web applications using frameworks such as Django and Flask.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Python is widely used in data science for tasks like data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:** Python is the language of choice for building and training machine learning models due to libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Scripting and Automation:** Python's simplicity and readability make it ideal for writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks, such as:\n",
    "  - File Manipulation\n",
    "  - System Administration\n",
    "  - Testing\n"

    "# Python 2 vs Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2 and Python 3 are two major versions of the Python programming language. Python 3 was introduced as a significant, non-backward-compatible upgrade to the language to address some design flaws and add new features. Some of the key differences include:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Print Statement:\n",
    "- **Python 2:** `print` is a statement (`print \"Hello\"`).\n",
    "- **Python 3:** `print` is a function (`print(\"Hello\")`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Division:\n",
    "- **Python 2:** Dividing two integers can result in another integer (e.g., `5/2` results in `2`).\n",
    "- **Python 3:** Division always results in a float (e.g., `5/2` results in `2.5`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unicode Support:\n",
    "- **Python 3:** Handles strings as Unicode by default.\n",
    "- **Python 2:** Treats strings as ASCII by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax:\n",
    "- Python 3 introduced some syntactic changes, such as:\n",
    "  - Function annotations\n",
    "  - Extended unpacking\n",
    "  - and more...\n",
    "\n",
    "As of January 1, 2020, Python 2 reached its end of life (EOL), meaning it no longer receives updates, including security patches. New projects are strongly encouraged to use Python 3.\n"
